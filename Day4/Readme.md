# Star Patter **** (4 rows)


# Problem Pattern

1. You need to master loop within a loop for this
2. Block Scope - Every time execution enters the block scope variables are re-initalized
3. You need a help of block-scoped variable in outer-loop 

# Complexity 

# Time Complexity 
1. O(2) 
    - Because the outer loop runs O(n) times & inner loop also runs O(n) times
    - Therefore, O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)

# Space Complexity
1. O(1) - constant
