1 0 1
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0

# Problem Pattern
1. Use two loops as usual
2. However, this time use even odd logic for printing


# Complexity

1. Time Complexity
- O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)


2. Space Complexity
- O(1) constant

# Problem Pattern
1. Use two loops as usual
2. You need to move the toggle out of the box to solve the problem


# Complexity

1. Time Complexity
- O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)


2. Space Complexity
- O(1) constant

# Question - Count Digit

# Problem Pattern
1. Use while loop, divide the number by 10 each time
2. Use formula of the children math book Quotient and Reminder

# Complexity

1. Time complexity
- O(n) - Linear

2. Space COmplexity
- O(1) - Constant
