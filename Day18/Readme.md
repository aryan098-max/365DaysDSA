# Question 

input = [ 1,1,0,0,1,1,1 ]
output = 3

# Problem Pattern

1. Traverse the entire array and declare two variables
2. currentCount and maxCount 
3. update maxCount and currentCount after encountering zero
3. Make sure to compare the value before returning as well

- Hint 
- Use Math.max(currentCount, maxCount) instead of if else

# Complexity

1. Time Complexity
- O(n) - Linear

2. Space Complexity
- O(1) - Constant
