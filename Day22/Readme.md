# Sum of n Number using Recurstion

Input - 5
Outut - 15 


# Problem Pattern
1. Base Case - 0
2. Call the function again and again until base case is reached
3. n + f(n-1) 

# Complexity

# Time Complexity
- O(n) - Linear

# Space Complexity
- The space complexity is also O(n) because each time a function is called
  a stack is added leading to O(n) 
- O(n) - Linear
