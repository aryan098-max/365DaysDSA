# Question 

input = [3,0,1 ]
output = 2

# Problem Patterns

# Note: The input also must include 0
- nums = [ 1,2,3,5,0 ]

1. Use a formula for finding total sum from (0,n)
2. Find total sum of the array & subtract from the total sum

# Complexity

1. Time Complexity
- O(n) - Linear

2. Space Complexity
- O(1) - Constant
