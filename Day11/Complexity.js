/**
  - Linear Search - n times
  - Binary Search - logn times

  O(1) > O(log n) > O(n) > O(n logn) > O(2^n) > O(n!)

  - Binary Search is an example of O(log n) as the problem is being divided by 2 
  every time

  n = 10

  n/2^x = 1 

  Taking log both sides 
  log n = log 2^x

  According to log, log 2 = 1
  log n = x 

  Similarly, we have O(n) Linear because the graph is straight line for this
