# Pattern

# Note: The most tricky part is how will you do the comparison with
- In our childhood, we learned how to differenciate between positive and negative number
  by comparing that number with zero

Step1: Iterate through each and every element
Step2: Declare a variable to keep the count number



# Complextiy 

# Time Complexity 
- Linear O(1) - Iterating through an entire array once

# Space Complexity 
- Constant O(1)
