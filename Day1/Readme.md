# Search an Element in an Array

# Problem Pattern 

Step1: Iterate through each & every element using a for loop
Step2: Search the element and return the index

# Complexity 

# Time Complexity
- Array is iterating through each element once therefore, O(n)
- Linear

# Space Complexity
- O(1) constant
