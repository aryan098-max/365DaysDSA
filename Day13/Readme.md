# Question Remove Element

# Problem Pattern
1. The approach is similar to remove duplicates
2. However, we are going to shift the element only if it doesn't match the element
3. Finally, increase the tracker to the next index
4. The main point is to only shift, if not equal to value

# Complexity

1. Time Complexity
- O(n) - Linear

2. Space Complexity
- O(1) - Constant
