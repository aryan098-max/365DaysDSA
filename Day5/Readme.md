# Star Patten 

/**

- Question

 * 
 * * 
 * * * 
 * * * * 

 */

# Problem Pattern

1. Use two loops 
2. First loop is for the row 
3. Second loop is for the column
4. Manipulate rows and column using first and second loop respectively

# Complexity

1. Time Complexity
- Two loops - O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)

2. Space Complexity
- O(1) Constant
