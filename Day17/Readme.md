# Question pattern

input = [ 0,1,0,3,2 ]
output = [ 1,3,2,0,0 ]


# Problem Pattern

1. use tracker for filling the non zero value
2. use i to check if the value is non-zero or not
3. Finally, use another loop which starts from n & fill rest position with zero


# Complexity

# Time Complexity
- O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

# Space Complexity
- O(1)
