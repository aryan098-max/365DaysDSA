# Introduction of Recurstion

1. Always add base case to stop the recursion
2. If you use (post decrement --), you will stuck in the infinite loop
3. Always use preincrement and predecrement during recursion

# Common Mistakes

1. Missing Base Case
2. Not Simplifying the smaller problem - n = n-1
3. Too deep recursion
4. Keeping in mind the Time Complexity
