# Introduction of Recurstion
1. Always add base case to stop the recursion
2. If you use (post decrement --), you will stuck in the infinite loop
3. Always use preincrement and predecrement during recursion

# Common Mistakes
1. Missing Base Case
2. Not Simplifying the smaller problem - n = n-1
3. Too deep recursion - Large Inputs (1000 elements) - Call stack might exceed
4. Keeping in mind the Time Complexity - It is similar to for loop

# When to use Recursion
1. Problem can be broken into sub problems
2. Trees & Graphs
3. Backtracking, DP, Divide & Conquer
