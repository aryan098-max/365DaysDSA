# Problem Pattern

1. This pattern is quite unique so far
2. Use i for printing the pattern


# Complexity 

1. Time Complexity
- Two loops - O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)

2. Space Complexity
- O(1) Constant

# Problem Pattern

1. Use two loops 
2. First loop is for the row 
3. Second loop is for the column
4. Manipulate rows and column using first and second loop respectively

# Complexity

1. Time Complexity
- Two loops - O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)

2. Space Complexity
- O(1) Constant
