# Approach 1
# Question Stone and Jewels

- Find how many jewels are there within the stones
Jewels - "aA"
Stones - "aAAbbbb"
Output = [2]

# Probelm Pattern

1. Introduce a global variable count for keeping the count of jewels within the stones
2. Use two loops compare the values of jewels with the stones increase the value of count
