# Question - Reverse String using array input
Note: Solve this problem without using extra space, solve within in O(1)
- Inplace - can't use an extra array, create an extra array
- Solving the problem without using an extra array means - you can't use 
  an extra array
- Do, inplace switching

# Problem Pattern
1. Traverse through the entire array
2. Solve with O(1), inplace switching
3. The input is an array with characters
4. Therefore, you are not mutating string, you are mutating array
5. Solve the problem using a temp variable



# Complexity

1. Time Complexity
- O(n), Linear

2. Space Complexity
- O(1), Constant

5. Solve the problem using a temp variable

- Extra Notes for second approach
6. Use halflen approach 
7. Swap using str[ length-1-i ] because index starts from zero
8. At last same temp variable apparoach
